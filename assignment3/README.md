# Algorithms in MapReduce

This assignment is devoted to designing and implementing MapReduce algorithms for a variety of common data processing tasks.

Again, my solutions were made using Python 3.3 environment with little difference from 2.7 version. Two initial files from the course, *MapReduce.py* (as a class) and *wordcount.py*, are placed in root directory.

The problems include:

* Inverted index
* Relational join implementation
* Social network friend statistics
* Asymmetric friend relationshships
* Unique sequences of nucleotides
* Matrix multiplication

I've also made quiz __Experimenting with MapReduce using JSMapreduce__. However, as the [site](http://jsmapreduce.com/) itself has expired, I was only able to solve "Poker Analysis" problem, using [Web archive](https://web.archive.org "Web archive"). The solution is presented in Javascript (Sample3), not Python (Sample 4), which was inactive.
