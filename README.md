# Introduction to Data Science

This repository contains my solutions to the problems, described in the assignments from ["Introduction to Data Science"](https://www.coursera.org/course/datasci "About the Course"), an online [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org) course led by [Bill Howe](http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~billhowe/ "Profile link") (Associate Director and Senior Data Science Fellow, eScience Institute, University of Washington).

I do this unofficially, without enrolling. Therefore, only descriptions of the assignments alongside with my own solutions will be placed here.
For the details about the course, please, visit the official page mentioned above or go to the [git repository](https://github.com/uwescience/datasci_course_materials "git repository").
