# Machine learning with R

The assignment is devoted to using R for the processing of the data, obtained by the SeaFlow environmental flow cytometry instrument, developed by [Armbrust Lab](http://armbrustlab.ocean.washington.edu/ "official site").

The scale can be quite large: a two-week cruise from one vessel can generate hundreds of gigabytes per day. However, a relatively small dataset that represents a 21 minute sample from the vessel is being used. It had a real-life degree, including bad data points.

I have used R 3.2.3 along with RStudio environment, proposing alternative solutions to some issues (for example, lattice package in Step 3). For the convenience, some plots are stored in this directory.
