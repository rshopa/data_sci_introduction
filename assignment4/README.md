# Large-scale processing in the cloud

This assignment is optional and requires charges for using Amazon services and Apache Pig platform for Hadoop.

As I was not enrolled in the course, I didn't pay for it. However, possible solutions to Problems 2 and 3 using Pig Latin script are presented.

For more information, please visit [course materials repo](https://github.com/uwescience/datasci_course_materials "datasci_course_materials") and [Pig Latin reference](http://pig.apache.org/docs/r0.7.0/piglatin_ref2.html "Pig Latin Reference Manual 2").
