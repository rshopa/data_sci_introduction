# Large-scale processing in the cloud

This assignment is optional and requires charges for using Amazon services and Apache Pig platform for Hadoop.

As I was not enrolled in the course, I didn't pay for it. However, possible solutions to Problems 2 and 3 using Pig Latin script are presented.

Again, my solutions were made using Python 3.3 environment with little difference from 2.7 version. Two initial files from the course, *MapReduce.py* (as a class) and *wordcount.py*, are placed in root directory.
