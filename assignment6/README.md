# Tableau for Teaching Assignment

This is the visualization assignment using [Tableau for Teaching](http://www.tableau.com/academic/teaching/licenses "fill in form"). The results are presented on [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/profile/roman1344#!/vizhome/shared/B3BJRZ6YJ "my page").

I have used here repair costs statistics from different airlines to point at unusual expenditures made by US Airways on the repair of A-320 aircrafts after collisions with animals. Costs of repair are also high for Business jets and Federal Express, in case of distinct jet models.
